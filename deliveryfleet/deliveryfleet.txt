Here we need Two driver features: mean distance driven per day (Distance_feature) 
and the mean percentage of time a driver was >5 mph over the speed limit (speeding_feature).

Perform K-means clustering to distinguish urban drivers and rural drivers.
Perform K-means clustering again to further distinguish speeding drivers 
from those who follow speed limits, in addition to the rural vs. urban division.
Label accordingly for the 4 groups.
