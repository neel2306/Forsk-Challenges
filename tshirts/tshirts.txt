T-Shirt Factory:

You own a clothing factory. You know how to make a T-shirt given the height 
and weight of a customer.

You want to standardize the production on three sizes: small, medium, and large. 
How would you figure out the actual size of these 3 types of shirt to better 
fit your customers?

Import the tshirts.csv file and perform Clustering on it to make sense out of 
the data as stated above.
